      <h2>About Rover Control Panel</h2>
      <p>
        The Rover Control Panel is a web application designed to remotely control and monitor our Arduino Uno-based rover
        equipped with an HC-05 Bluetooth module. With this control panel, you can explore and maneuver the rover in real-time
        over Bluetooth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our rover is equipped with various sensors that provide valuable feedback, such as ultrasonic sensors for distance
        measurement and a camera for capturing images along its path. The sensor feedback is displayed in the control panel,
        giving you a comprehensive view of the rover's surroundings.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Use:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure the Arduino Uno and the rover are powered on and the Bluetooth module is connected.</li>
        <li>Access the Rover Control Panel from any device with a web browser.</li>
        <li>Use the buttons and sliders in the control panel to direct the rover's movement (forward, backward, left, right).</li>
        <li>Observe the sensor feedback section to get real-time updates about the rover's status and surroundings.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We hope you enjoy using the Rover Control Panel to explore and interact with our rover. Feel free to contact us if
        you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
